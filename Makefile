# This is a very client-centric view of release engineering.

# from which specific science applications can be built.
#
# A service is composed of a client and a server, each of which
# should be independently deployable. Clients are composed of
# an application programming interface (API) and a command line
# interface (CLI). In our make targets, deploy-service deploys
# the server, deploy-client deploys the application
# programming interface libraries, and deploy-scripts deploys
# the command line interface (usually scripts written in a
# scripting language but java executables also qualify), and the
# deploy target would be equivelant to deploying a service (client
# libs, scripts, and server).
#
# Because the deployment of the server side code depends on the
# specific software module being deployed, the strategy needs
# to be one that leaves this decision to the module developer.
# This is done by having the deploy target depend on the
# deploy-service target. The module developer who chooses for
# good reason not to deploy the server with the client simply
# manages this dependancy accordingly. One option is to have
# a deploy-service target that does nothing, the other is to
# remove the dependancy from the deploy target.
#
# A smiliar naming convention is used for tests.

# For starters, we will consider cpan style packages for perl
# code, we will consider egg for python, npm for javascript,
# and it is not clear at this time what is right for java.

# Deployment:
# 
# We are assuming our primary products to the community are
# client side application programming interface libraries and a
# command line interface (scripts). The deployment of client
# artifacts should not be dependent on deployment of a server,
# although we recommend deploying the server code with the
# client code when the deploy target is executed. If you have
# good reason not to deploy the server at the same time as the
# client, just delete the dependancy on deploy-service. It is
# important to note that you must have a deploy-service target
# even if there is no server side code to deploy.

deploy: deploy-client deploy-service

# deploy-all deploys client *and* server. This target is deprecated
# and should be replaced by the deploy target.

deploy-all: deploy-client deploy-service

# deploy-client should deploy the client artifacts, mainly
# the application programming interface libraries, command
# line scripts, and associated reference documentation.

deploy-client: deploy-libs deploy-scripts deploy-docs

# The deploy-libs and deploy-scripts targets are used to recognize
# and delineate the client types, mainly a set of libraries that
# implement an application programming interface and a set of 
# command line scripts that provide command-based execution of
# individual API functions and aggregated sets of API functions.

# Deploying scripts needs some special care. They need to run
# in a certain runtime environment. Users should not have
# to modify their user environments to run kbase scripts, other
# than just sourcing a single user-env script. The creation
# of this user-env script is the responsibility of the code
# that builds all the kbase modules. In the code below, we
# run a script in the dev_container tools directory that 
# wraps perl scripts. The name of the perl wrapper script is
# kept in the WRAP_PERL_SCRIPT make variable. This script
# requires some information that is passed to it by way
# of exported environment variables in the bash script below.
#
# What does it mean to wrap a perl script? To wrap a perl
# script means that a bash script is created that sets
# all required environment variables and then calls the perl
# script using the perl interperter in the kbase runtime.
# For this to work, both the actual script and the newly 
# created shell script have to be deployed. When a perl
# script is wrapped, it is first copied to TARGET/plbin.
# The shell script can now be created because the necessary
# environment variables are known and the location of the
# script is known.

# Deploying a service refers to to deploying the capability

compile-docs: build-libs

# build-libs should be dependent on the type specification and the

# have the most up-to-date libs and documentation if your compile-docs
# target depends on the compiled libs.
